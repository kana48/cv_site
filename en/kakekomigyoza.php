  <p class=travaux-single-text>As part of the professional project at the Caweb Master Multilingual web communication, we redesigned and localized in four languages the website of a restaurant in Tokyo, Japan. The website is available in Japanese, English, French and Chinese. We were a team of four people, and I was the project manager. I was also in charge of some of the front-end development of the site. </br>
  This site is not yet officially in use because the pandemic has restricted foreign tourists from visiting Japan. But you can see our work at the link below.
